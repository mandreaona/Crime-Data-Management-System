# Crime Data Management System

This is the final project for a SQL course my colleague, [Nicola Bini](https://github.com/Nicola-Bini), and I took as part of my Master of Business Analytics at Hult International Business School. The objective was to create a high-level database design documentation with sql scripts, particularly a Crime Data Management System. This crime data documeentation enabled us to identify important criminal scenarios and transform them into insights. 

NOTE: The crime data used in this project was created at random, per the professor's instructions, and is meant for academic purposes only, to demonstrate how the process and workflow would function.
